                <h1>Welcome to my Website!</h1>
                <p class="heading2">Thank you for visiting my website. Before you explore the site, please take a moment to read the following instructions:</p>
            </div>
            <div class="instructions" style>
                <p>1. Please don't expect much. I am just coding this website for learning purposes only.</p>
                <p>2. If in future I add some stuff like a login page, please don't use your actual passwords because I will have access to all of them.</p>
                <p>3. I am just sharing it for I don't know why reasons.</p>
                <p>4. I just add a bunch of stuff that I learn in here to see how it works and test my own skills.</p>
                <p>5. Don't spam my email address that I have embedded in the website and don't try calling the phone number either. I don't use that anymore.</p>
                <p>6. Note that there will be just a bunch of nonsense in there, lol.</p>
                <p>7. The website has sooo many errors, I know about them I am just too lazy to fix them and I don't even know how to fix some of them lolol.</p>
                <p>8. Some bugs are now so away from fixing that whole structure will need to be reformed for them for which I don't have energy to do so.</p>
                <p>9. Don't change page size. The wallpaper is glitchy because I embeded it in body rather than html.</p>
                <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; background-color: transparent;">
                    <a href="main.html">Enter the Website</a>
